// Assuming the existing code uses a testing framework like Jest or Mocha
// and the missing variables are part of that framework's assertion library.
// We'll add a generic import for assertion libraries.  If the specific
// library is known, the import should be adjusted accordingly.

import { expect } from "chai" // Or any other assertion library
import { describe, it } from "mocha"

// The rest of the original code would follow here.
// Since the original code is not provided, this is a placeholder.

// Example usage to demonstrate the fix:
describe("Workflow API", () => {
  it("should do something", () => {
    const result = 1 + 1
    expect(result).to.equal(2) // Using 'expect' from Chai
  })
})
